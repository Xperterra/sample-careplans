# Sample FHIR CarePlan Resources

Sample ðŸ”¥FHIR CarePlan and related resources for chronic care scenarios.

The sample resources are based on a storyboard for chronic conditions that illustrates the clinical documentation used and created by care providers, and communication flow between a patient and care team members involved in his/her long term care. The chronic condition selected for the first storyboard is [Type II Diabetes Mellitus (Type II DM)](./Care Plan Storyboard - Diabetes Mellitus.pdf).

Because FHIR is still evolving there may be different versions of the resources:

- the `master` branch contains **STU-3** (v`1.8.0`) resources
- the `develop` branch contains (nothing at this time)
