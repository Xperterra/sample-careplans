# Sample FHIR CarePlan Resources

Sample ðŸ”¥FHIR CarePlan and related resources for chronic care scenarios.

The sample resources are based on a storyboard for chronic conditions to illustrate the clinical documentation by care providers, and communication flow between a patient and care team members involved in his/her long term care. The chronic condition selected for the first storyboard is Type II Diabetes Mellitus (Type II DM).
- The [Type II DM storyboard](./â€˜Care Plan Storyboard - Diabetes Mellitus.pdfâ€™) document is included in this repository.

Because FHIR is still evolving there may be different versions of the resources:

- the `master` branch contains **STU-3** (v`1.8.0`) resources
- the `develop` branch contains (nothing at this time)
